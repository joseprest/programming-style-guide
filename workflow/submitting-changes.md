# Submitting changes

1. Create a new branch for your changes. Give this a descriptive name, like `status-component` or `fix-responsiveness`. Names should be short and words should be separated by hyphens.

    - Using the Git CLI, the command to create a new branch and switch to it is `git checkout -b branch-name`.
    - You can also create a new branch with [GitHub Desktop](https://desktop.github.com/) or using the GitHub website.

2. Make your changes and commit them to your branch. Make sure that:

    - Your changes have been tested and function according to their specifications.
    - Your code follows style guidelines.
    - You have run any linters and tests, if applicable.

3. Open a pull request to the main branch using the GitHub website in order to get feedback on your work. Include screenshots if applicable.

4. If there are changes requested, commit and push changes to your branch. You do not need to open a new pull request, the existing pull request will automatically update.

5. If there are new changes in the main branch that are not in your branch, update your branch with these changes. A pull request cannot be merged if it is not up to date with the main branch.

6. If the pull request is approved, it will be merged.
